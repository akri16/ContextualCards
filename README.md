## Usage

Plug this Component into your XML and play with it in your Activity/Fragment ðŸ˜„

```xml
<com.akribase.cardcomponent.ui.CardComponent
            android:id="@+id/component"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

```kt
private fun initComponent(component: CardComponent) {
        component.onFetch = { viewModel.fetchUISpec() }
        component.onHC3Remove = { viewModel.remove(it) }
        viewModel.isFetching.observe(this) {it:Boolean -> component.isLoading = it }
        viewModel.uiSpec.observe(this) {it:List<CardGroup> -> component.render(it) }
}

```

## **Building**

It is recommended that you run Gradle with the `--daemon` option, as starting up the tool from scratch often takes at least a few seconds. You can kill the java process that it leaves running once you are done running your commands.

Tasks work much like Make targets, so you may concatenate them. Tasks are not re-done if multiple targets in a single command require them. For example, running `assemble install` will not compile the apk twice even though `install` depends on `assemble`.

### **Clean**

`gradle clean`

### **Debug**

This compiles a debugging apk in `build/outputs/apk/` signed with a debug key, ready to be installed for testing purposes.

`gradle assembleDebug`

You can also install it on your attached device:

`gradle installDebug`

### **Release**

This compiles an unsigned release (non-debugging) apk in `build/outputs/apk/`. It's not signed, you must sign it before it can be installed by any users.

`gradle assembleRelease`

### **Test**

Were you to add automated java tests, you could configure them in your `build.gradle` file and run them within gradle as well.

`gradle test`

### **Lint**

This analyses the code and produces reports containing warnings about your application in `build/outputs/lint/`.

`gradle lint`
