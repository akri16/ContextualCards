## Motivation
With the traditional development process the user interface is embedded in the app which makes it inflexible and difficult to update. But the data is fetched from a remote server. The data displayed in the app is always up-to-date and can be modified any time through a backend system. What if we could apply the same technique we use for data to the user interface itself?
<br>Enter server-driven UI. In a SDUI implementation the user interface in the app is a blank slate. The app knows it will be rendering a listing screen but makes no assumptions about how that screen will look. The app makes a request to the server which returns both the UI and the data together.
<br>The response from the server is some form of proprietary markup that the app understands. Instead of fetching a list of products, the app fetches a list view, which contains a set of row views, each of which contains text and image views with information about spacing, alignment, color and typography. The app renders the response from the server and the result is identical to the version using traditional development techniques.

## Features
- A standalone container, that displays a list of Contextual Cards
- A Contextual Card is used to refer to a view that is rendered using json from an API. These views are dynamic and their properties like images, color, texts, buttons (CTAs) etc. can be changed from backend at anytime.
- This container works completely independently of everything else, such that, we can add this to container to any fragment/activity and it should work. (Plug-and-Play component)
- App renders contextual cards in a list based on the API response that you get from the API
- Shows loading states and errors

## Architecture
The project has 2 module:
1. app
2. cardcomponent

### App
It deals with fetching and deserializing the JSON from the API and passing it down to the UI layer and to the _cardcomponent_ as **List\<CardGroup\>**
It uses **Model View ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture <br> <br>
<p align="center"><img alt="Architecture Diagram" src="https://github.com/akri16/ContextualCards/blob/master/assets/arch-diagram.png" width="500"/></p>

### Card Component
It is the custom view that deals with actually rendering the **List\<CardGroup\>** passed down from _app_. It converts it to **List\<RenderableCardGroup\>** and then renders it.

**Card** from the API
```kt
data class Card(
    val name: String,
    val formattedTitle: FormattedText? = null,
    val title: String?,
    val formattedDescription: FormattedText? = null,
    val description: String? = null,
    val icon: CardImage? = null,
    val bgImage: CardImage? = null,
    val gradient: Gradient,
    val url: String? = null,
    val bgColor: String? = null,
    val cta: List<CTA>? = null
)
```
This is simplified into **RenderableCard** after:
1. Processing the _Entities_,
2. Formatting the text with spans
3. Creating the final background from _bgColor_, _gradient_, and _url_

```kt
data class RenderableCard(
    val name: String,
    val title: CharSequence,
    val desp: CharSequence,
    val icon: String?,
    val bg: RenderableBG,
    val cta: CTA?,
    val url: String?
)
```

## Usage

Plug this Component into your XML and play with it in your Activity/Fragment ðŸ˜„

```xml
<com.akribase.cardcomponent.ui.CardComponent
            android:id="@+id/component"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

```kt
private fun initComponent(component: CardComponent) {
        component.onFetch = { viewModel.fetchUISpec() }
        component.onHC3Remove = {it:H3Remove -> viewModel.remove(it) }
        viewModel.isFetching.observe(this) {it:Boolean -> component.isLoading = it }
        viewModel.uiSpec.observe(this) {it:List<CardGroup> -> component.render(it) }
}

```

## **Building**

It is recommended that you run Gradle with the `--daemon` option, as starting up the tool from scratch often takes at least a few seconds. You can kill the java process that it leaves running once you are done running your commands.

Tasks work much like Make targets, so you may concatenate them. Tasks are not re-done if multiple targets in a single command require them. For example, running `assemble install` will not compile the apk twice even though `install` depends on `assemble`.

### **Clean**

`gradle clean`

### **Debug**

This compiles a debugging apk in `build/outputs/apk/` signed with a debug key, ready to be installed for testing purposes.

`gradle assembleDebug`

You can also install it on your attached device:

`gradle installDebug`

### **Release**

This compiles an unsigned release (non-debugging) apk in `build/outputs/apk/`. It's not signed, you must sign it before it can be installed by any users.

`gradle assembleRelease`

### **Test**

Were you to add automated java tests, you could configure them in your `build.gradle` file and run them within gradle as well.

`gradle test`

### **Lint**

This analyses the code and produces reports containing warnings about your application in `build/outputs/lint/`.

`gradle lint`
